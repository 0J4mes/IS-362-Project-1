# **IS 362 - Project 1: Airline Arrival Delays Analysis**

##  Introduction
This project analyzes airline arrival delays across five destinations using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. 
We compare delays for two airlines and visualize the results.

##  Dataset
The dataset contains airline delay data for five destinations.

##  Key Findings
1. **Average Delay Analysis**
   - Airline A has lower average delays than Airline B.
   - Some destinations show early arrivals (negative delay values).

2. **Destination-wise Analysis**
   - New York and Miami had higher delays.
   - Chicago had mixed results, with Airline A arriving early.
